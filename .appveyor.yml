# This file is used to configure the AppVeyor CI system, for testing on Windows machines.
#
# Code loosely based on https://github.com/ogrisel/python-appveyor-demo
#
# To test with AppVeyor:
#    Register on appveyor.com with your GitHub account.
#    Create a new appveyor project, using the GitHub details.
#    Ideally, configure notifications to post back to GitHub. (Untested)

        # Version Restrictions
        #    Enaml supports Python 2.7 and also 3.4 onwards.
        #    PyQt4 only available for Python <3.6, tested only on Python 2
        #    PyQt5 only available for Python >=3.5.
        #       PyQt5 version 5.11.2 doesn't run on Python 3.5.
        #    PySide1 only available for 2.6 <= Python <=3.4. Wheels only for 32-bit.

        # Strategy:
        #    Run all tests using only pip (Travis uses conda)
        #    Test each 64-bit Python version, but only the latest known patch.
        #    Test the oldest and the latest 32-bit Python versions release.
        #    Test with PyQt4 where available, otherwise PyQt5 in each version.
        #    Test QScintilla on latest Python version available.
        #    Test PySide1 in latest Python version it runs on.
        #        - Failure is allowed and won't block PRs.
        #    Test PySide2 in latest Python version available
        #        - Failure is allowed and won't block PRs.
        #    Only test single toolkit installs (e.g. not QT4 and QT5 on same install)

        # VARIABLES
        #    NAME: just a comment for distinguishing builds in Appveyor.
        #    PYQT_VERSION: Determines PyQt versions installation
        #    PY_QT: Determines Pyside version installation (if present), and is used by
        #           Enaml.
        #    PYTEST_QT_API: In Python 3.4, pytest-qt needs a hint about the right interface.
        #    QSCINTILLA: Set to "Yes" to install it.


        # 64-bit versions, PyQT, latest to oldest. Test QScintilla support on
        # latest.
