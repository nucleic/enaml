""" An example which demonstrates the use of the `func` keyword.

Code in the body of the function has access to the same scope as a bound
expression. This consists of an implicity `self` which resolves to the
object on which the function was declared, as well as the identifiers
declared in the enclosing `enamldef` block. It also has access to the
dynamic scope which is rooted on `self`.
