""" An example of the `ToolBar` widget.

This example demonstrates the use of the `ToolBar` widget. A `ToolBar`
can have an arbitrary number of children, which must be `Action` widgets.
In this fashion, a `ToolBar` is very similar to a `Menu` in a `MenuBar`.
The `ToolBar` also supports `ActionGroup` widgets in the same manner as
a `Menu`. A `ToolBar` is typically used as a child of a `MainWindow`,
but it can also used as a child of a `Container` and layed out using
constraints.

Implementation Notes:

    The tool bar facilities in Wx are very weak. Due to technical
    limitations, the `ToolBar` widget in Wx does not have the slick
    docking features which are available in Qt. It also does not
    look nice when used as the child of a `Container`. If a `ToolBar`
    is required for a particular application, strongly prefer the
    Qt backend over Wx (this is generally a good life-rule).
