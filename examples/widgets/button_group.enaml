""" An example of button groups in Enaml.

This example shows the usage of the `ButtonGroup` widget in combination
with multiple `RadioButton` widgets.

The intent of this example is to show how several buttons in different
containers can still be in the same group, ensuring that only one can
be selected at any given time.

This widget is currently only available for Qt.
