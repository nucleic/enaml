""" An example of using the FocusTraversal advanced widget feature.

The FocusTraversal is an advanced widget feature for controlling the
order in which widgets receive focus during Tab and Shit+Tab keyboard
events. It enables two methods which can be implemented as declarative
Enaml functions which will compute the next/previous focus widgets on
demand.

In this example, the traversal handlers simply return the next or
previous field from a double-linked list of fields. However, there
is no restriction on how the handlers actually compute the focus
widgets.
