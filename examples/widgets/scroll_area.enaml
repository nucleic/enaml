""" An example of the `ScrollArea` widget.

A `ScrollArea` can have at most one child which must be an instance of
`Container`. When to show the scroll bars is determined automatically
based on the sizing constraints of the `Container`. However, that
policy can be changed through the attributes 'horizontal_policy' and
'vertical_policy'. These attributes can be set to 'as_needed',
'always_on', and 'always_off'. The default is 'as_needed'.
