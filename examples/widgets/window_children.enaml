""" An example of using children with a `Window` widget.

The `Window` widget serves as the fundamental top level widget for UIs
in Enaml. `Window` widgets may have at most one child widget which must
be an instance of `Container`. This `Container` is referred to as the
'central widget' of the UI. The sizing behavior of a `Window` is largely
determined by the sizing constraints of the central widget.

In this example, we use a `Container` and a few `PushButton` widgets to
add content to the `Window`. Clicking on the first `PushButton` will
print the central widget of the window to the shell.

This example focuses on features of the `Window` widget, see the other
examples for explanations of the other widgets and language features.
