""" An example of the `Splitter` widget.

A `Splitter` is a widget which can hold an arbitrary number of children
which must be instances of `Container`. The `Splitter` will separate
each `Container` with a bar which can be dragged by the user to change
the space allocated to the containers. This example shows how complex
arrangements can be acheived by nesting `Splitter` widgets inside
child `Container` widgets.

Implementation notes:

    The splitter support on Wx is poor. Certain behaviors, like initial
    splitter sizing does not work well (if at all). If a production
    application requires splitter support, prefer the Qt backend over
    Wx (this is generally a good life-rule).
