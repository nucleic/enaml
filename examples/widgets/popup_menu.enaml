""" This example demonstrates how to popup a menu.

A menu can be popped up in 2-ways. The first is by declaring the menu as
a child of a widget and setting the 'context_menu' attribute to True. The
second method is by creating the menu on-demand, and then invoking it's
'popup()' method to show the menu at the current mouse location.
