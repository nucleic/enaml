""" An example of the `hbox` layout helper with auxiliary constraints.

This example is nearly identical to the `hbox.enaml` example. However,
this time we add some auxiliary constraints to make the buttons equal
widths. When resizing the window, each button is therefore guaranteed
to expand by the same amount.
