""" An example which demonstrates linear relational constraints.

This example shows how one may define a constraint as a linear relation
of some other constraint. In this example, the horizontal position and
width of a `PushButton` depends up the width of the `Container`, and the
vertical position of another `PushButton` depends upon the width of the
other `PushButton`.

This is a contrieved example, but serves to demonstrate the feature.
