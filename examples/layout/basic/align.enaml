""" An example which demonstrates the use of the `align` layout helper.

In this example, we use the `align` layout helper to align various
constraints of the children of a container. The layout consists of
a Field pinned to the top of the Container. Below the Field are two
PushButtons each of which have their `left` boundary aligned. The
top PushButton is then aligned with the `h_center` of the Field.
