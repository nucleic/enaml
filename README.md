Welcome to Enaml
================

Enaml is a programming language and framework for creating professional quality
user interfaces with minimal effort. Enaml combines a domain specific declarative language with a constraints based layout system to allow users to easily define
rich UIs with complex and flexible layouts. Enaml applications can be run on any
platform which supports Python and Qt.

A few highlights of the framework:

* A declarative language which extends the grammar of Python
* A set of operators which automatically track runtime dependencies
* A layout system which uses symbolic constraint declarations
* A design which encourages model-view separation
* A well documented and easy to follow code base

See [the docs](http://nucleic.github.io/enaml/docs) for more information.
