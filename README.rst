Enaml is a programming language and framework for creating professional quality
user interfaces with minimal effort. Enaml combines a domain specific declarative language with a constraints based layout system to allow users to easily define
rich UIs with complex and flexible layouts. Enaml applications can be run on any
platform which supports Python and Qt.

Highlights of the framework
===========================

* A declarative language which extends the grammar of Python
* A set of operators which automatically track runtime dependencies
* A layout system which uses symbolic constraint declarations
* A design which encourages model-view separation
* A well documented and easy to follow code base
