Enaml is a programming language and framework for creating professional quality
user interfaces with minimal effort. Enaml combines a domain-specific declarative language
with a constraints-based layout system to allow users to easily define 
rich UIs with complex and flexible layouts.

Highlights of the framework
===========================

* A declarative language which extends the grammar of Python
* A set of operators which automatically track runtime dependencies
* A layout system which uses symbolic constraint declarations
* A design which encourages model-view separation
* A well-documented and easy-to-follow code base

Supported Versions
===========================

Enaml applications can be run on any platform which supports Python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6) and `Qt <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/supported-platforms.html>`_ (versions 4 or 5). 

This includes Linux, Windows, macOs, Android and iOS. (Automated testing of Enaml runs on Linux.)

Examples
=================

The `Enaml documentation <http://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ includes many  `fully-functioning code samples <http://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html>`_ of how to use Enaml. They range from `simple demonstrations of how a widget is used <http://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/ex_progress_bar.html>`_, to advanced explorations of the customisability of Enaml GUIs.


The `Employee Tutorial <http://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/tut_employee.html>`_ shows how constraints and validators can be used to create easy-to-use and professional-looking applications:

The `Dock Item Alerts Example <https://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/ex_dock_item_alerts.html>`_ shows some of the customisability of the appearances of an Enaml application. This application is based on Visual Studio 2010 style, with dockable items, but has some customisations based on the importance of the alerts being shown.

The `Button Ring Example <https://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/ex_button_ring.htm>`_ goes the other way. The result is neither professional-looking nor easy-to-use, but it shows the power and  flexibility of constraints-based layout - it might be silly, but this could not be achieved with typical layout systems.
