Form Example

::

    An example of the `Form` widget.
    
    A `Form` is a simple subclass of `Container` which automatically lays
    out it children in two columns, neatly aligning the widget edges. If
    a `Form` has an odd number of children, the last child will span both
    columns. The typical use case of a `Form` alternates `Label` and `Field`
    instances, but there is not restriction on the types of children used
    with a form, except that they be constrainable.
