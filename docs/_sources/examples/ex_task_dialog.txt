Task Dialog Example
===============================================================================

    An example of using the Enaml stdlib task dialog components.
    
    The `task_dialog` stdlib module provides a set of components which can be
    easily assembled for a dialog which follows the style of the Windows 7/8
    task dialogs.
    
    A task dialog is assembled by declaring a `TaskDialogBody` element as the
    child of a `Dialog`. Within the body, the various special dialog area
    containers can be declared to add content to the dialog. The dialog body
    takes care of automatically laying the various areas.
    
    This example creates a Dialog which uses all of the task dialog areas,
    which is not a requirement for user code. In fact, all of the areas are
    optional, and the developer is free to choose the bits needed for the
    task at hand.
    
    Creating a task dialog from scratch using the area elements is flexible,
    but can be a bit tedious. For the more common use cases, Enaml provides
    some predefined task dialogs. See `message_box.enaml` for an example.
