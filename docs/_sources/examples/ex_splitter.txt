Splitter Example
===============================================================================

::

    An example of the `Splitter` widget.
    
    A `Splitter` is a widget which can hold an arbitrary number of children
    which must be instances of `Container`. The `Splitter` will separate
    each `Container` with a bar which can be dragged by the user to change
    the space allocated to the containers. This example shows how complex
    arrangements can be acheived by nesting `Splitter` widgets inside
    child `Container` widgets.
    
    Implementation notes:
    
        The splitter support on Wx is poor. Certain behaviors, like initial
        splitter sizing does not work well (if at all). If a production
        application requires splitter support, prefer the Qt backend over
        Wx (this is generally a good life-rule).
