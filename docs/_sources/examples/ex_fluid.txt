Fluid Example

::

    An example of how constraints can be used to create fluid layouts.
    
    At the top of the layout is an `Html` widget which expands to fill the
    available space. Below the `Html` are four `PushButton` widgets. On the
    left are the Add and Remove buttons, which hug the left side of the window
    and stay close to each other. Hugging the bottom right corner is the Share
    `PushButton`. Centered is the Change Mode `PushButton`. However, as the
    window gets resized, the Change Mode button may not be able to be centered,
    but it will always leave a gap between it and its two neighbors. This
    type of behavior (selective centering) is difficult-if-not-impossible to
    acheive with traditional box style layouts.
