Find Replace Example
===============================================================================

:download:`find_replace <../../../examples/layout/advanced/find_replace.enaml>`

::

    An example demonstrating the layout for a find-replace dialog.
    
    To make the buttons look nice, weak constraints are set requesting that
    the adjacent buttons have the same width after satisfying all of the
    other constraints. The left border of the Fields should be aligned. The
    width taken up by the buttons is controlled by the lower row since the
    PushButton labels "Replace" and "Replace & Find" take up more space than
    "Find" and "Find Next". The lower row's buttons are not equal widths,
    because that would take up a bunch of extra space, but the top row's
    buttons do expand equally to take up the available space.
