============
Installation
============

Installing Enaml is a straight-forward process. There are three approaches to
choose from.

Anaconda
--------

If you use the `Anaconda`_ Python distribution platform (or `Miniconda`_,
its lighter-weight companion), the latest release of Enaml can be installed
using conda from the conda-forge channel::

    $ conda install enaml -c conda-forge

.. _Anaconda: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda
.. _Miniconda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

Wheels
------

If you don't use Anaconda, you can install Enaml and its dependencies,
pre-compiled, through PIP, for most common platforms.

You will need three things:

* `Python`_
* Enaml (and its dependencies)
* a toolkit rendering library

Python
~~~~~~

Enaml is a Python framework and requires a supported Python runtime. Enaml
currently supports **Python 3.7**, **Python 3.8**, **Python 3.9** and
**Python 3.10**.

.. note::

    Currently Enaml does support the match syntax introduced in Python 3.10 in
    .enaml files

The most recent Python releases are available on the `Python Downloads`_ pages.
Installers are available for Windows and OSX. Linux users should install Python
using their OS package manager.

.. _Python: http://python.org
.. _Python Downloads: http://python.org/download


Enaml and Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install enaml and (almost) all of its dependencies through the pip
command line.::

    $ pip install enaml

Toolkit Rendering Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enaml's declarative widgets provide a layer of abstraction on top of the
widgets of a toolkit rendering library. Enaml ships with a backend based on Qt5
and third-party projects such as `enaml-web`_ and `enaml-native`_ provides
alternative backends.

Enaml uses the `QtPy`_ library as compatibility layer to support transparently both
PyQt and PySide. PyQt has been supported for a longer time and has been more
heavily tested.

On 32 and 64-bit Windows, 64-bit OS X and 64-bit Linux, with Python
versions >=3.6, it can be installed via pip::

    $ pip install qtpy pyqt5

.. note::
    There is no pyqt5 wheel available for 32-bit Linux.

.. note::
    On Enaml >= 0.13 you can specify a rendering library using extra_requires, ie::

    $ pip install enaml[qt5-pyqt]

    Currently, you can use either [qt5-pyqt] to use PyQt5 or [qt5-pyside] to
    use Pyside2.

Compiling it yourself: The Hard Way
-----------------------------------

Building Enaml from scratch requires a few external dependencies. The
sections below describe how to install Enaml and all of its dependencies from
scratch. The instructions assume that the user's system has a C++ compiler and
the `Git`_ command line tools installed and available on the system path.

.. _Git: http://git-scm.com

`Setuptools`_ and `Pip`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setuptools is a Python package which makes installing other Python packages a
breeze. Pip is the default package manager for Python. The installation
instructions below assume that Setuptools and Pip have been installed in the
target Python environment. Follow the relevant `Setuptools Install`_
instructions for adding the package to your system.

.. note::
    Recent versions of Python (Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4) installed
    from the official binaries install come with those tools installed.

.. _Setuptools: http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools
.. _Pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
.. _Setuptools Install: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/1.1.6
.. _Pip Install: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

`Ply`_
~~~~~~

The Enaml framework extends the grammar Python language with new declarative
syntax constructs. To accomplish this, Enaml has a fully compliant Python
3.7/3.8/3.9 lexer and parser with added support for the new syntax. These
components are built using the PLY parsing tools, which contain Python
implementations of lex and yacc.

Ply can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install ply

.. _Ply: http://www.dabeaz.com/ply

`Cppy`_
~~~~~~~

Enaml also uses Cppy, a small C++ header library, to build some pre-compiled
`Python extensions`_.

Cppy can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install cppy

.. _Cppy: https://github.com/nucleic/cppy
.. _Python extensions: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html

`QtPy`_
~~~~~~~

The Enaml framework uses the `QtPy`_ library as a compatibility shim between
the various toolkit rendering libraries.

QtPy can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install QtPy

.. _PyQt: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro
.. _PyQt5: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/
.. _QtPy: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/QtPy/
.. _Qt: http://qt-project.org
.. _PyQt Downloads: http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
.. _Homebrew: http://brew.sh
.. _PySide: http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide
.. _Pyside2: http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python

`Kiwisolver`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enaml's layout engine is built on top of the `Cassowary`_ linear constraint
optimizer. This is the same algorithm used by the Cocoa Autolayout engine in
OSX. Kiwisolver provides Python bindings to a C++ implementation of the
Cassowary algorithm.

Kiwisolver can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install kiwisolver

.. _Kiwisolver: https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi
.. _Cassowary: http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/cassowary

`Bytecode`_
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Enaml compiler depends on the ``bytecode`` module, which is a Python
library used to generate and modify bytecode.

Bytecode can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install bytecode

.. _Bytecode: https://github.com/vstinner/bytecode

`Atom`_
~~~~~~~

Atom is the Python framework which provides the foundational object model for
Enaml. Atom objects are extremely lightweight, fast, and support a robust
implementation of the `Observer Pattern`_. If these traits seem all too ideal
for a project like Enaml, it's because Enaml was the primary motivation behind
the development of Atom.

Atom can be installed with the ``pip install`` command of `Pip`_::

    $ pip install atom

Alternatively, cloning and building the latest (unstable dev) version of Atom from source is simple::

    $ git clone https://github.com/nucleic/atom.git
    $ cd atom
    $ python setup.py install

.. _Atom: https://github.com/nucleic/atom
.. _Observer Pattern: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern

`Enaml`_
~~~~~~~~

The last item on the list is Enaml itself. The latest (unstable dev) version
can be installed with just a few commands::

    $ git clone https://github.com/nucleic/enaml.git
    $ cd enaml
    $ python setup.py install

.. _Enaml: https://github.com/nucleic/enaml

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Enaml is known to run on Windows, OSX, and Linux; and compiles cleanly
with MSVC, Clang, GCC, and MinGW. However, primary development of the
framework occurs on Windows (7, 8 and 10), so some quirks and bugs may be
present on the other platforms. If you encounter a bug, please report
it on the `Issue Tracker`_.
