.. rubric::`stylesheets`

    Styles sheets are a powerful feature which allow the developer to
    customize the visual appearance of a view independent from the
    view's structural definition. Inspired by CSS, but with all the
    dynamism provided by the Enaml language.

.. rubric::`workbenches`

    Enaml Workbenches provide a set of low-level components which can
    be used to develop high-level plugin applications.  Workbenches 
    enable the developer to write large UI applications which can be 
    *safetly extended at runtime* by other developers.
